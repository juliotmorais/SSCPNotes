security triad
confidentiality-
	protect info and systems from unauthorized access
integrity
	protect against unmodified modifications
availability
	protect and ensure access/backups
DOS attacks, attack the availability
sttenography, hide info in other files or images
hash  is a data digest used to insure data integrity
digital signature
creation-
	compute hash value of message, encrypt hash with senders private key
verification-
	decrypt with senders public key
	check hash against message
non-repudiation - user cant say they didnt do it
redundancy, high availability, fault tolerance
patching
accountability- logging who does what and when for non repudiation
centralized log server, secure
privacy compliance
hipaa - healthcare privacy
phi patient health information
ferpa -student educational records
glba - financial security regulations
coppa- children privacy online
gdpr - european privacy law with all eu citizens workin with eu citizens
employee privacy, minimzation-only get needed info, limit access, encyption, masking
accounting groups - vendor creation and payments are seperate
devs cannot put their own code into production, it is reviewed by a seperate team
two person control
physical/media asset management and life cycle, putting in request for item, item is reviewed, ordered, identified and labeled, put into use, returned to management and possibily recycled
config management - request for change, description of change, expected impact, risk assessment, rollback plan, identity, proposed implementation - it must be reviewed
baselines - snapshots of system at a point in time
version control
software licensing-acceptable use, shrinkwrap with pua agreements, click through agreements
data at rest, data in motion, big data(bigger than normal databases)
data classification for levels
military- top secret, secret, confidential, unclassified
business- highly sensitive, sensitive, internal, public
storage-physical, acess controls, encryption
transmission, what kind, encryption, locations, methods
lifecycle - min/max data retention, disposal/wiping
data owner - ownership, responsibility, business leaders
data steward - day to day governance, delegated responsibility
data custodian - store and process info, usually it staff
10 principles ofdata privacy-GAPP generally accepted privacy principls
1.management 2.notice/contact 3.choice/consent 4.collection
5. use/retention/disposal 6.access 7.disclosure 
8.security 9.quality 10.monitoring/enforcement
minimal collection, monitor third parties
security baseline- minimum usually used as a general cover or highest level needed, needs to be monitored
Vendors, government, and organizations have security standards
good idea is to use encryption like aes 128 but organization can modify to use stronger 256
standards can be referenced and modified
file permissions-ntfs permissions,
read=r, write=w,execute=x, user owner=u, group owner = g, others = o
chmod[ownership]{+/-}{permissions} {file}
chmod o+r PublicFile
AEScrypt
you can encrypt a full hard drive
mac -file vault
windows - bit encrypt
HSM-hardware security module, used to encrypt hardware
TPM-trusted platform module -disk encryption
cloud data sec issues-encryption, access control
data classification-sensitivity,criticality,labeling,
securitycontrols-
preventative controls-stop a problem from even happening, firewall
detternt controls - persuade an attacker from attacking, dog
detective controls - identify breaches during or after, camera
corrective controls- fix issues after, backup
technical controls- tech use for protection, antivirus
admin controls- human driven process for protection, screening
physical control
false positive - false alarm, issue reported when no issue
false negative - fails to trigger alarm when issue happens
COBIT-control objectives for IT, business focused control framework
ISO27001 - common standard of control framework
NIST 800-53- government standard control framework
SIEM system
back up data, test that you can restore data
account reviewing, screening, testing
keep track of auditing, version history
Management and operational controls - reviewing and auditing
process data -electornic and paper records
management oversight, security metrics, 
KPI-keyperformance indicator, show success of program, looks back
	decrease in breaches, and impact, and increase of SLA and controls, number of training events, number of outages, number of issues
KRI-Key risk indicator, show future risks, forward looking
	impact, implement, measure, support, reliability, sensitivity
PCI DSS-Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
internal auditor - reports to management
external auditor - outside groups that come in
audit findings - statements of noncompliance, must be fixed
external auditors - statements of weakness, but fix if you want
control testing should take place often, learn to manage exceptions
compensating control - how to deal with risks of other controls
	- tall wall, but gate is low, THEREFOER put a guard at gate
security policy frameworks - 
	policies, dont be too specific,mandatory
	Standards, details of controls,mandatory, referenced from other places
	guidelines, optional
	procedures, depends on company
Info Sec Policy- 
	individual who is responsible for sec
	sec roles and responsibilities
	authority for creation of sec standards
	authority for incident response
	process for policy exceptions and violations
Private Policy- 
	how does company collect use and store information about users
Acceptable Use Policy
	expectations of users use
least privilege, seperation of duties, mandatory vaction, job rotation
PII - personally identifiable information
compliance programs-laws,regulations,standards,
user habits, clean desk policy, tailgating,
 BYOD-bring your own device, COPU-Company owned personally used
chain of custody
physical security, data center, media storage, back up, wiring,
air temp, cooling equipment,  64.6 F-80.6F, humidity, 
dewpoint 41.9-50F, HVAC, hot and cold aisle, cold=front,hot=back
exinguishers- 
	a=common combustible
	b=flammable liquids
	C=electric
	d=heavy metal
	K=kitchen
wet pipe = water in pipes
dry pipes= no water in pipes until fire
electricmagnetic interference- disrupt or spying
