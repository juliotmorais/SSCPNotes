rdp is port 3389
netbios is 137 138 139
smtp is 25 to send
pop is 110 to get 
imap is 110 to get
stateful inspection - tracks open connection
web app firewalls protect gainst xss and web app attacks
load balancers deal with balancing requests, ssl certificate management, url filters, and other web app security tasks like limiting access to parts of websites
proxy servers can d o anyomization and content filters
gws are similar but more security, can block attacks
vpn endpoints can be fw routers servers or vpn concentrators
vpn traffic are resource heavy, concentrators are best if you have alot of traffic

IPSEC- better for site to site but hard to configure
SSL/TLS - better for remote

signature detection, most effective, antivirus uses this, if new attack it fails, low false positive, its a black list
anomoly detection, tries to build model of normal activity, can have high false positive, its like a white list
anomoly detection = behavior detection = heuristic detection

utm-unified threat management, combining sec stuf like network attack protection, filters, routing, vpn, ID and IP, URL filter, content inspection, malware inspection, email/spam filter

cdn-content distibution network , similar to load balancer, but you leave it up to another entity for you

traffic shaping, qos, quality of service, what kind of traffic should be prioritized
WAN optimization
deduplication -only send  data once,
compression, caching, latency optimization
good for multiple sites

ICANN- internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
ARIN,APNIC,AFrinic,lacnic, ripe ncc

4.3 billion possible ip addresses in ipv4
nat, private ips, and ipv6 fixed shortage
10.x.x.x range
172.16.x.x-172.31.255.255 range
192.168.x.x range

pat is similar to nat, but uses ports instead of private ip addresses

network border
best place for firewall might be inbetween internet,dmz and intranet

span ports copy all traffic on switch
span port on aggregation switch wont show traffic between access switches under it
aggregation/distribution switches connect downstream access switches(connected to users) to eachother
SIEM security information and event management, uses AI, good near systems generation records
vpn concentrator, put on own vlan, can determine remote user
ssl accelerator, handle crypto work for TLS connections
load balancers
SSL accelerators and load balancers are probably in DMZ most liekyl
ddos mitigation, 

Network Access Control, NAC, intercepts traffic, verifies that user can connect before communication
uses 802.1x authentication, supplicant, does nac stuff
switch that device connects to is the authenticator for supplicant
backend authentication server does authentication for all servers

user with nac supplicant conncets to network,
supplicant gives authenticatior with credentials 
authenticator gives it to authentication server with radius
if okay auth. server says OK radius message to authenticator 
authenticator allows user to access network
if NOTokay reject radius mesage is sent

NAC can also do posture checkign and role based access, identity based
students role may be placed on student vlan
posture checks check for antivirus software, valid signatures 
if posture fails, it will be put into quarantine vlan where it can patch up

radius 
remote access dial in user server
centralized, still used, uses UDP, not encrypted

TACAS
cisco
terminal access controller acess control system
xtacacs
tacacs+
uses tcp, encrypts

radius and tacacs+ is commonly used

Remote network access, remote shell- commandline, remote desktop -graphical access
telnet, ssh
ssh name@xxxxx.xxx, ssh -i uses a certificate
RDP uses full encryption to desktop access on windows

virtual desktop, IdentityaaS,SoftwareaaS, PlatformaaS, InfrastructureaaS
application streaming, screen scraping provides access to mainframe
SDN software defined networking, uses code to program network
control plane-respoinsible for makign routing and switching things happen
data plane - actually moves stuff around
sdn seperates with controller to decide and programs it

port isolation and private vlans are the same, used in hotels, do not connect to other devices on same switch

defense in depth, mulitple overlapping sec controls
eaves dropping:
vpns, tls, vlan segmentation,
access control: NAC, role appropriate vlan, mac filtiering, port security, 
perimeter:
ACL,ips/ids, firewall

Voice over IP voip, telephony
voice to digital form for IP
encryption distorts voice
seperate vlans for voice is a good idea instead of encryption, NAC is good here

XMPP extensible messaging and presence protocol, jabber, open source
SMS, short message service, texting, no encryption, easy to spoof,
 third party apps are good like apple,Line, whatsapp, signal
 
storage networks, 
NAS network attached storage, uses CIFS(file shares) and NFS(linux file shares)
SAN storage area networks, larger than nas

SAN use raw storage instead of file system, connected to device over network, uses fibre channels
NAS looks like file server

fibre channel-fiberoptic between SAN and devices
fibre channel over ethernet -replaces fiber optic with ethernet links, slower
iscsi-uses scsi over network connection

storage traffic best on dedicated vlan or infrastructure, carefully trunk or vpn it

shadow rule - rule that will never be implemente due to top diwn rule order
promisuous rule, too much access given, ,aybe by lazy or typo
orphaned rule-  rules never taken off of  system, but not intended to be used
fw rule maangement and review it often

standard ACL- based on ip address
access-list number permit/deny source mask
access-list 1 deny 10.3.1.0 0.0.0.255 , this blocked 10.3.1.x range

extended access control list, furthers it with src/dst ports, named acls, src/dst ips etc

firewalls are better than routers for access control, fws have more rule capabilities, more sec, integrate with ids/ips better, 

vlan pruning-limit unecessary exposure of vlans by limiting trunked switches
vlan hopping-changing to a different vlan by pretending to be a switch and asking to trunk to get into a vlan
you should deny automatic vlan trunk negotiation to prevent hopping
port security, limits mac adddresses connected to ports
static port security, most secure, manually confugre valid MAC addresses
dynamic - uses sticky so switch remembers the first mac address and permit only that one

flooding attacks, dos
SYN flood, send a bunch of syn connection requests, BUT do not answer return syn/ack so the other side is left waiting
MAC flood, flood lots of mac address so it fills mac addresses
flood guard is a good preventative, and port security too

routing loops, broad cast storm,
STP spanning tree ptocol is good to prevent loops

firewall logs, lots of details about times and rules and type of connection, detective
netflow, is network traffic logs,(like capture in wireshark)
SIEM uses AI to compile and put stuff together, helps analysis

snmp, simple network management protocol
agen tthat runs on device, 
when amangement wants to communicate with agent,  it uses getRequest and gets back snmp response
SetRquest is to configure agent, respoesn says if sucessful or not
Traps are sent by agents to tell about events to SNM device
SNMPv3 IS SECURE, Eearlierversion are NOT secure

data theft - confidentiality
defacement - integrity
dos - availability

botnets to hide attacker
smurf attack- send ping with src as victims ip address to many places, victim gets echo request flood
amplified ddos, attacker sends small request to many ppl, victim gets large replies
reply/request = amplification  512 bytes/64byes = 8x amplification

eavesdropping, MITM, manin the middle, network device tap, dns poisoning, arp poison, 
replay attack, prevented with session token, replay is DOS and eavesdrop
xmas tree packet, all bits set to 1, some systems cant handle
depending on response, system can be identified
dns posioning, changing dns server mapping to direct to another bad server
arp poisoning, points to wrong mac address, only works on local networking
typosquatting

wifi is a set of standards for radio frequency and tramistters and recievers, uses a chip, WAP, wireless access points, 
802.11 2mbps
802.11b 11
802.11h 22
802.11n 600
SSID broadcasting, mac filtering for wifi but is time consuming and ineffective if they have sppofing
vpn is good on a public connection

no encryption- BAD
WEP - wired equivelent privacy, susceptible to attack
WPA- uses TKIP, teporal key integrity protocol which changes encryption key for each packet, secure
WPA2 is best, usses CCMP 
PSK-preshared key, usually on home router, password on router,64 hexadecimal string or 8-13 characters, uses key stretching to turn into 64 hexadeximal, if changes ppl have to reinsert, cant revoke ppl who left
Enterprise authentication, uses username and password, EAP
LEAP-lightweight EAP, uses chap, cisco, NOT SECURE
EAP-exensible authentication protocol, broad framework, secure and not secure, depends
PEAP-protected peap, eap+TLS
Captive Portal- authorization page like starbucks wifi

attena -
omnidirectional antenna, donut shape, rubber duck 
directional - focuses in one direction, wave

wirless site survey for best wifi placement spot based on physical and radio signals

WEP, wired equivelent privacy, 
WPA -wifi protected access, TKIP, temporal key integrity protocol + RC4 128 key, some attacks , somewhat secure, wpa2 is better
WPS, wifi protected setup - home, 8digit pin password, cant change pin ever
latest encryption is best

propagation attack, pulling signals out of the air, jamming, interferance, emp atack, pulling signal from air or copper wire, war driving, war chalking, blue snarf(force pair or taking data), bluejack(sending unsolicited message),

rogue/evil twin- fake wifi access point, bypass configs, can mess up others
built in intrusion detection, unknown  radio waves, handheld tools to pinpoint
evil twins look liek legit wifi spots, but can redirect to phishin, like a watering hole
karma toolkit makes evil twins

nfc-near field communication, short range, bluetooth
bluejacking-spamming with bluetooth, spam/phishing
bluesnarfing-force pair, grants access/pulls info from device
disable if not in use, apply firm ware update
