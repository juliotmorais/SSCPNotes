building an incident response team
NIST 800-61
NIST, national institute of standards and technology
develop an incdient response plan
think through the incident response process and document it
Incident Response plan:
	statement of purpose, stategies and goals, apprach, communication, senior approval
COmmunications plan: limit external communication and content to trusted parties, to prevent news and hackers from knowing.
Involving law enforcement needs CAREFUL consideration and are held to different standards, secure your channels
Isolate an issue like a first responder
first responder main priority is to contain damage
escalation to appropriate level for responce, report, triage-low,med,high
low-minimal impact, usuall handled by first responder
moderate- medium impact,prompt notification to management
high- ciritical, immediate ful response, incident resposne mobilization
containment strategy-damage potential, evidence preservation, service availability, resource requirements,rexpected effectiveness, solution timeframe
balance business needs and security objectives
attackers may detect your preventative actions and may speed up, destroy or flee
phased apprach to recovery and reconstitution
learn from the incident and plan for future events
NIST Incident REsponse Process=Preparation,Dection/analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, post incident activity
validation process that issue is over, no weird leftovers, review accounts, get rid of breached accounts
Operational Investigation-investigate issues that are happening,
	just fixproblem
Criminal Investigation-done by government agencies, 
	high possible standard,
Civil Investigation-non criminal, just between 2 parties, contract
	disputes, not so high standard of evidence
regulatory investigation-done by government for regulations
Interviews are voluntary, Interrogations are not
Evidence-
	real:object 
	documentary:written info, needs to be authenticated, original is best
	testimonial:witness, direct witness or expert opinion
	nohearsay admitted
digital forensics-tech investigations,criminal, collect preserve intepret digital info from a device, never take an action that contaminates data
volatility:how long the data lasts, hard drive is better than RAM
Order of Volatility:Network traffic,Memory Contents,System/ProcessData,Files,Logs,Archived REcords
Take an image of the evidence, then use those images for investigation
Writeblockers is a device that sits between analysers and prevents write attempts to the evidence
hashes never change
screenshots, memory chart, process table
network forensics
netflow data shows timmestamp and who ip addresses and ports,no payload
intellectual property
coding styles and signatures
embedded devices like an alexa can be used as evidence, but needs a subpeona
chain of custody to see who has custody of evidence and make sure its not compromised, date of collection,name of who and PII about them, logs of events, transfer, tamper resistant to show if its been opened
Whoever needs to know of incident shouyld be notified, keep records of communication
Who needs to know?Chief infomation officer, director, reponse teams, officers, owners, 
sometimes external parties need to know, but be careful with this and what wyou say
US-Cert is a federal report team
Formal Incident Report
ediscovery- presevation, collection, production
	if there is a charge or litigation, both sides need to preserver
	their info first
business continuity planning-
	bcp, business activities, systems, and controls that are covered
bia, business impact assessment, identifies and prioritizes risk
	includes ALE with what kind of threat
BIA Control,s Remove SinglePointOfFailure, ensure redundancy
HighAvailability- multiple systems liek redundancy
Fault Tolerance- Protect a system from failing in the first place
Load Balance-Spread demand across systems
common poitns of failure -
	power supply due to many parts, sometimes 2 powersupplies are good.
	protect against disks breaking, use RAID to prevent
RAID lvl 1, disk mirroring, 2 disks, same data on both
RAID lvl 5, uses 3 or more disks to store data and parity information
qos-quality of service, services 
disaster recovery-contain damage, recover capacities, assessment
RTO-recovery time Objective-max time it should take to recover service
RPO-Recovery Point Objective-max time data may be lost
Backups-tapes, disk-to-disk,cloud
full backup, differntial backup (data that was added/modified since last full backup), incremental backup (data modified/added since last full/incremental backup)
Validation for BackupVerification,regularly test them
hot site- fully operational, stocked with euqipment and data, expensive
warm site- has hardware/data, but not running, so cost is inbetween
cold site - empty center, core equpment, but no server/data, inexpensive
offsite backups
DisasterRecovery Testing, validate it, identify updates, 
disaster recovery testing types- 
  readthrough(checklists), walkthrough(table talk),simulation(testing)
full interruption test may disrupt business
parrallel test needs activate DR site
