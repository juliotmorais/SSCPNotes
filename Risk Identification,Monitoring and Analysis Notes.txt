Risk Management
Risk Avoidance, Transference(insurance, reputation doesnt work here though), Mitigation, acceptance
risk recasting = changing impact of a risk, risk management
quantitative risk assessment-
	AV-Asset Value-original cost OR depreciated cost OR replacement cost
	EF - Exposure Factor - How much impact
	SLE - Single Loss Expectancy
		AV * EF = SLE
	ARO- how often does it happen
	ALE - How much money expected to lose each year
		SLE * ARO = ALE
	MTTF - mean time to failure - average time till it breaks
	MTBF - mean time between failures
	MTTR - mean time to repair - average time till repair
system authorization
control assessments and effectiveness
NIST SP 800-37 standards of framework
Categorize information system
Select security controls
implement security controls
access security controls
authorize information system
monitor security controls
Risk Register- tracks risks
	description
	category
	probability and impact
	risk rating
	risk management actions
identify the threats-
	asset focus, asset as basis
	threat focus, how threat affects as basis
	service focus, which product is affected
STRIDE attacks
Spoofing
Tampering
Repudiation
Information disclosure
Denial of Service
Elevation of privilege
Reduction Analysis - breaking a system down into smaller components
threat modeling, repeated attacks might mean a certain deficency in defense or software, or business practice
passive tools, observe, 
active tools, interact, able to disrupt
honeypot, decoy server to attract attackers and watch/log them
protocol analyzer, wireshark
port scanner,nmap
vulnerability scanner, nessus
threat- external force
vulnerability - sec weakness
risk - vulnerability+threat
baseline scanner, architecture review
penetration test - white box, grey box, black box
CVSS common vunerabulity score
  AV-attack vector- 
	L-Local-physical/logical access
	A-Adjacent-Local network
	N-Network-remote access
  AC-Access COmplexity
	H-High-specialized
	M-Medium-somewhat special
	L-Low-No specialized
  Au-Authentication
    M-Multiple-multifactor authentication needed
	S-Single-single authentication needed
	N-None-No authentication needed
  C-Confidentiality
    N-None-no impact
	P-Partial-Partial Impact
	C-Complete-All info impacted
  I-Integrity
    N-None-no impact
	P-Partial-Partial Impact
	C-Complete-All info modified
  A-Availability
    N-None-no impact
	P-Partial-Partial Impact
	C-Complete-All systems down
CVSS2 AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
Remotly accessed, No specialized, No authentication, partial impact on CIA
0-3.9 Low, 4-5.9 Medium, 6-9.9 High, 10 Critical
Prioritization-Vulnerability severity, system criticality, infomation sensitivity, remediation difficulty, system exposure
who to report to? cybersec team, management, system+network engineer. What is the issue?Why important? Affected?
How crucial is the system?How is the data stored/transfered?
How crucial is the data?How severe is the vulnerability?
How is it exposed? What is the Attack Vector? Is remediation possible?
Remediation Workflow-
	Detection,Analysis,Remediation,Remediation Validation
Automizing-open new tickets when vulnerability appears, prioritize, assign remediation, OR perform remediation automatically and close automatically
Remediation+emergency maintenance should be covered in SLA and MOU
Logs-Event Viwer in Windows, App Log-software messages, system log-issues with system/storage, sec log - audit failure
logging is a detective control, technical one, and admin one when reviewed by admin
sucessful and failed things can be logged, trends and anomolies should be noted for base logs
SIEM security information and event management
logs should be sent to a SIEM as a central collection point
SIEM works with AI to detect trends
firewall log- can detect a suspicious connection
webserver log - can detect sql attack
database log - can detect a large query
router log- can detect large outbound/inbound data of dos
Monitoring Process - Define based on needs, Establish with metrics and frequency, Implement and make reports, Analyze/Report, Respond to findings, Review/Update based on needs
heuristic analysis - self discovery, i/e: big data spike compared to year long collection 
investigation for something you cant explain, Rise or Drop in attacks, behavioral anomolies, availability analysis to check that its still up
logs need regular review
no jargon in reporting, simplify but accuratly report, use visualization like a graph, make recommendations
Internal compliance-verify that standards are being held like antivirus on every machine
External compliancy - verifythat laws and regulatory obligatiosn are being met
intrests-anomalous activity, intrustion, unauthroized changes
legal/ethical issues-browsing history, geolocation, PII
privacy laws
person who info is colelcted from needs to be notified
only minimal info is ok, and also about what kind of analysis
legal and ethical, just because you can doesnt mean you should
code review
developers do not put their code into production
reviewers or other group does
this is seperation of duty
Code Review/Software Life/Fagan inspection
Planning, Overview, Preparation, Meeting, Rework, FollowUp
code tests, code review
static code test -analyze for defects without executing
dynamic code test- execute to verify function, output and flaws
synthetic transaction - prescrited inputs for the testing
fuzz testing- gives valid and invalid input to software for testing, dev supplied, script supplied, generation supplied or mutated input
OWASP can fuzz, USE ONLY WHEN 
APIs often interact with back end databasses so are a risk
APIs are crucial to business ops
misuse by users/acceptable use, hackers dont care, unexpected input, missing input, injection, unavailable, invalid input
how to test the software? possible use cases, possible inputs, functions, lines of code, conditional branching with more ppl
software test converage can be automated
